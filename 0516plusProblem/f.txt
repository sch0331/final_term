the sky hums like a quiet violin the city sleeps with one eye open neon lights flicker like forgotten dreams and he walks alone through the hour that belongs to no one
his name is written in fog his footsteps dissolve into the silence of the street lamps her shadow waits at the edge of his vision never closer never farther just there like a whisper like a secret he almost remembers
a clock ticks somewhere far away or maybe inside his chest or maybe it never ticks at all maybe time bends here like soft metal like breath on cold glass
he turns a corner and the world folds he steps through and the air changes softer heavier filled with all the things he never said and all the things he still could
she stands there in a coat too big her hands in her pockets her eyes holding the shape of the moon not the light just the shape the possibility of it
you forgot again she says or maybe she does not say it at all maybe the words are just air and memory stitched together in the spaces between star
he nods not because he understands but because some part of him always has some part of him never stopped waiting never stopped walking through this night
a streetlight dies the wind carries a song he cannot name he reaches out and the world begins again
